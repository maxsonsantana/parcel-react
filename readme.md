This is a basic boilerplate for a react-app that uses `parcel-bundler` behinde the scenes for create and use the app.

This is a small script that will clone into a new folder named **my-project**, remove the old .git and create a new one for you.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shinspiegel/parcel-react.git my-project; cd my-project; rm -rf .git; git init; git add -A; git commit -m "Initial files"; yarn; yarn dev;
```
