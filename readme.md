This is a basic boilerplate for a react-app that uses `parcel-bundler` behinde the scenes for create and use the app.

#### What is comes?

- [x] React App
- [x] Yarn friendly
- [x] Parcel-bundler
- [x] React Context
- [x] Now with tests using `@testing-library/react`
- [x] And jsDoc for intelissense

#### Clone it!

This is a small script that will clone into a new folder named **my-project**, remove the old .git and create a new one for you.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shinspiegel/parcel-react.git my-project;
cd my-project;
yarn pre:dev;
git add -A;
git commit -m "Initial files";
yarn;
yarn dev;
```
